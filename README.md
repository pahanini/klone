# Klone

A tool to clone repositories into a folder structure matching the repository's domain plus username.

For example:

git@github.com:pahanini/klone.git cloned to $KLONE_HOME/github.com/pahanini/klone
git@yourdomain.com:user/repo.git cloned to $KLONE_HOME/yourdomain.com/user/repo

This tool follows a domain/username/repo folder structure, which I use to manage multiple repositories efficiently. 
It eliminates the need for manual directory setup.
